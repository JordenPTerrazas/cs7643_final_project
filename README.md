# cs7643_final_project


# Requirements
- If pip_requirements.txt is giving you issues it might be because of the cuda
dependencies. Can remove those + the pytorch dependencies and install them with
the instructions on here (https://pytorch.org/).
- Also may need https://github.com/chirlu/sox. If you're on a windows machine
I am not sure about how to install this so maybe we can work off a colab. On ubuntu
its 'sudo apt-get install sox'
